# Getting Started as an Open Source Scientist, Mathematician, or Engineer

This `github` repository will serve as the official resource for the NCSSM 2024 J-term course: *Getting Started as an Open Source Scientist, Mathematician, or Engineer*.

## Course description
Modern scientific research requires scientists to understand not only the content area they are studying, but to also have a strong understanding of the computing and data processing tools necessary to collect, analyze, and communicate their data and results. This course will teach students how to use open source tools in their scientific and technical workflows to conduct open source research and create open source publications.

At the end of the course, students will be able to install and run programs using their computer's terminal, use version control tools like github to effectively share code and data as part of a research team, produce rich interactive articles and websites based on their scientific and/or technical work, and much more. No previous experience with computing or scientific research required! The skills could be used to complete work in any technical field to produce transparent and reproducible outputs for everything from a physics lab report, to a journal ready chemistry paper. 

## Course Schedule
The course will run from Tuesday, January 16th - Thursday, January 25th.
